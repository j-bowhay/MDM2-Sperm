How to:

Use the avi converter m file to convert the .avi to a .tif stack

Install SpermQ (https://github.com/hansenjn/SpermQ) and SpermQ Preparator (https://github.com/hansenjn/SpermQ_Preparator)
Guide here for using: https://github.com/hansenjn/SpermQ/blob/master/Manual/SpermQ%20Manual.pdf

For some reason we need to convert the files to greyscale again so open the frame-1_SpQP.tif in ImageJ and go Image -> Type -> 8-bit, then save. 

Only then will SpermQ analyze the sperm movement.
